1.Introduction and Context
This  is  a  brief  introduction  to  the  purpose  system  that  describes  the  environment  orcontext  of  the  proposed system, the problem it addresses, and how the proposed system will solve that problem.  It should be less than a  page.    A  couple  of  paragraphs  to  a  ½  of  page  would  sufficient  in  most  cases.    For  the  most  part,  this description should be very similar to the project over in the project plan.
2.Users and their Goals
This  section  contains  identifies  of  the  users  of  the  proposed  system  and  their  goals,  illustrated  and  supported by Use Case diagrams.   Here “users” is a board term that could include other software systems.
3.Functional Requirements
This  section  contains  requirements  or  constraints  on  the  functioning  of  the  proposed  system,  written  in  way that  doesn’t  pre-suppose  “how”  the  system  will  accomplish  those  requirements.    The  requirements  should  be organized  in  hierarchy  of  increasing  specificity  and  presented  in  outline  form  so  they  are  easy  to  reference.  Each requirement must stand on its own because it could be referenced or quoted in other documents without the  benefit  contextual  information.    Where  appropriate,  the  requirements  could  include  statements  about  of the rationale (motivation) and/or priority (importance to the client.)
4.Non-functional Requirements
This  section  contains  requirements  that  describe  and/or  constrain  the  development  process.    For  example,  a non-functional  requirement  may  state  that  development  will  follow  an  Agile  method  with  weekly  iteration meetings.
5.Future Features
This section contains a list of ideas or features that are beyond the scope of the project.6.GlossaryThis section contains a list important terms and their definition.
